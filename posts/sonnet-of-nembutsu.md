title: A Sonnet for Amida Buddha

Reflection of a single nianfo  
disrobes me of the ills of endless past  
and shines the light of donkey's years ago  
to bring me to the endless peace at last.  

There was a man who many practise did  
who asked his Lama "will I soon finish?"  
The Lama told him "Now I do not kid  
you are but one percent towards your wish!"  

Beseech Amida through the primal vow,  
so easy that it is a pain to get,  
the way to bring a Buddha to you now  
but still you cannot go unless you let.  

Accept this simple message here for thee,  
and then forever will you become free!  

With metre:
