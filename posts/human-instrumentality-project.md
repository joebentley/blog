![Last episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion]({{ "/images/neon_genesis_evangelion.jpg" | url }})

Warning: contains spoilers for all of the Neon Genesis Evangelion TV series.

Neon Genesis Evangelion is about mankind's fight against giant alien beings called Angels, using giant robots called Evangelions. It is secretly also about a project to bring mankind to enlightenment called the Human Instrumentality Project as performed by a secret agency.

Basically, the show gives us an explanation for human suffering, almost like an alternative theory to Buddhism given by Schopenhauer, called the "hedgehog's dilemma". It says that humans are like hedgehogs, we deeply desire to get closer to each other but we have thorns, so we are always in a state of dissatisfaction. The thorns of humans in the show are analysed as arising from the Jungian "unconscious". The goal of the Human Instrumentality Project is to effectively destroy all the thorns so that all humans can realise their desire to be close. The last two controversial episodes of the show demonstrate this process for the case of our boy Shinji. We witness the interrogation of his subconscious in a kind of psychoanalysis, and then his breakthrough as he comes to truly accept himself and thus is able to fully connect with others. The other characters, who have presumably also undergone the process, then congratulate him.

However, what I want to discuss is the interesting reaction to this project by fans of the show online. For many people, the ending of Neon Genesis Evangelion is distinctly bad, that is, the TV show is the "evil ending" where the bad guys win. They see the project as a _bad_ thing to happen.
